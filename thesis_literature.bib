  abstract = {While there has been a recent growth of interest in the Digital Twin, a variety of definitions employed across industry and academia remain. There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.},

The proposed methodology consists of two main pillars; Digital model creation and Digital Twin enabling. Following this procedure, which is analyzed in the paper, the user is able to define, create and utilize the digital model of a resource, as well as to enable the DT concept. A digital model of an industrial robot was created aiming to validate the proposed methodology which can be utilized potentially in predictive maintenance applications.},

  abstract = {The industrial environment is slowly transforming to a networked system of systems nature with industry 4.0. Automation systems are getting more production friendly by being more reconfigurable and adaptable. The plant engineering process is also getting improved by offering modular architecture, model-based engineering, etc. This transformation necessitates novel methodologies in maintenance practices as well. With the emergence of predictive maintenance techniques, sometimes it is possible to predict a breakdown and thus conveniently schedule the corrective maintenance. But this is not always the case, the incidence of unscheduled corrective maintenance is prevalent in an industrial environment. And the methodologies for corrective maintenance have to be reshaped fitting to the new plant environment. This paper introduces a new modular corrective maintenance methodology, using the digital twin of an automation module. Fault ascription support for a human technician, performing corrective maintenance action of an automation module is provided by its digital twin and associated visual interface. A use case scenario is propounded and future visions are presented.},

  abstract = {Intelligent manufacturing is regarded as the next generation manufacturing mode with powerful learning and cognitive capacities enabled by new generation information technologies such as Internet of Things, big data analytics, edge computing and artificial intelligence. To provide an insight into intelligent manufacturing, this paper takes autonomous manufacturing cell as implementation scenario and proposes a data- and knowledge-driven framework for digital twin manufacturing cell (DTMC), which could support autonomous manufacturing by an intelligent perceiving, simulating, understanding, predicting, optimizing and controlling strategy. In addition, three key enabling technologies including digital twin model, dynamic knowledge bases and knowledge-based intelligent skills for supporting the above strategy are analyzed. Then, the implementing methods of DTMC are introduced through a thus constructed digital twin robot, and the usage of data and knowledge for supporting the automous operations of DTMC is also discussed. Finally, benefits of DTMC in smart product-service systems (PSS) and its current challenges are summarized.},

  abstract      = {{This paper presents a review of the state of the art for digital twins in the application domain of engineering dynamics. The focus on applications in dynamics is because: (i) they offer some of the most challenging aspects of creating an effective digital twin, and (ii) they are relevant to important industrial applications such as energy generation and transport systems. The history of the digital twin is discussed first, along with a review of the associated literature; the process of synthesizing a digital twin is then considered, including definition of the aims and objectives of the digital twin. An example of the asset management phase for a wind turbine is included in order to demonstrate how the synthesis process might be applied in practice. In order to illustrate modeling issues arising in the construction of a digital twin, a detailed case study is presented, based on a physical twin, which is a small-scale three-story structure. This case study shows the progression toward a digital twin highlighting key processes including system identification, data-augmented modeling, and verification and validation. Finally, a discussion of some open research problems and technological challenges is given, including workflow, joints, uncertainty management, and the quantification of trust. In a companion paper, as part of this special issue, a mathematical framework for digital twin applications is developed, and together the authors believe this represents a firm framework for developing digital twin applications in the area of engineering dynamics.}},
