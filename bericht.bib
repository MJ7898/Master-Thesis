Traditional cloud computing is no longer sufficient to support the diverse needs of today's intelligent society for data processing, so edge computing technologies have emerged. It is a new computing paradigm for performing calculations at the edge of the network. Unlike cloud computing, it emphasizes closer to the user and closer to the source of the data. At the edge of the network, it is lightweight for local, small-scale data storage and processing. This article mainly reviews the related research and results of edge computing. First, it summarizes the concept of edge computing and compares it with cloud computing. Then summarize the architecture of edge computing, keyword technology, security and privacy protection, and finally summarize the applications of edge computing.},

   abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) pose novel challenges compared with traditional networks. To answer such challenges a new communication paradigm, data-centric communication, is emerging. One form of data-centric communication is the publish/subscribe messaging system. Compared with other data-centric variants, publish/subscribe systems are common and wide-spread in distributed computing. Thus, extending publish/subscribe systems into WSNs will simplify the integration of sensor applications with other distributed applications. This paper describes MQTT-S [1], an extension of the open publish/subscribe protocol Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [2] to WSNs. MQTT-S is designed in such a way that it can be run on low-end and battery-operated sensor/actuator devices and operate over bandwidth-constraint WSNs such as ZigBee-based networks. Various protocol design points are discussed and compared. MQTT-S has been implemented and is currently being tested on the IBM wireless sensor networking testbed [3]. Implementation aspects, open challenges and future work are also presented.},

However, the selection of a standard and effective messaging protocol is a challenging and daunting task for any organisation because it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements. Copious messaging protocols have been developed and employed by various organisations based on their requirements in the last two decades. Though, none of them is able to support all messaging requirements of all types of IoT systems. Messaging protocol is an ongoing dilemma for the IoT industry; consequently, it is important to understand the pros and cons of the widely accepted and emerging messaging protocols for IoT systems to determine their best-fit scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents an evaluation of the four established messaging protocols MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP for IoT systems. Firstly, it presents the broad comparison among these messaging protocols to introduce their characteristics comparatively. Afterwards, it performs a further in-depth and relative analysis based on some interrelated criteria to gain insight into their strengths and limitations. Thus, based on this detailed evaluation, the user can decide their appropriate usage in various IoT systems according to their requirements and suitability.},

As well as being smart technologically speaking, a smart home should also never forget to retain the “home nature” when it is serving its users. In this paper, we first analyze the relationship among services, spaces, and users, and then we propose a framework as well as a corresponding algorithm to model their interaction relationship. Later, we also realize the human-system interaction framework to implement a smart home system and develop “pervasive applications” to demonstrate how to utilize our framework to fulfill the human-centric interaction requirement of a smart home. Finally, our preliminary evaluations show that our proposed work can enhance the performance of the human-system interaction in a smart home environment. © 2012, IEEE},

An important step towards an engineering discipline of software is a formal basis for describing and analyzing these designs. In this paper we present a theory for one aspect of architectural description: the interactions between components. The key idea is to define architectural connectors as explicit semantic entities. These are specified as a collection of protocols that characterize each of the participant roles in an interaction and how these roles interact. We illustrate how this scheme can be used to define a variety of common architectural connectors. We provide a formal semantics and show how this leads to a sound deductive system in which architectural compatibility can be checked in a way analogous to type checking in programming languages.},

@report{Shen2004,
   abstract = {With the development of Internet and next generation networks in telecommunications, more and more new services are required to be introduced into networks. Introducing new services into traditional network is always associated with standardizing new protocols. The progress of protocol standardization usually takes several years, which cannot meet the increasing demands of the applications in Internet and next generation networks. Service customization in network systems may be one possible solution to cope with this problem. Based on the principle that network service is provided by interactions among protocol entities, this paper proposes a conceptual model of service customization (SECUM) by separating the service logic from protocol interactive logic within existing network architecture. The theory of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is used to formalize the SECUM in order to locate exactly the service logic and to define precisely the SECUM. For validating the SECUM's usability in practical network systems, this paper also proposes an implementation model for SECUM: a component-based protocol implementation model (CPIM). CPIM discomposes protocol entity into application component, service component, message component and communication component. Service component associates application component with message component. Users or network managers can customize network services by configuring service component. The paper shows respectively the applications of SECUM and CPIM by proposing a customizable IP service model based on SECUM and describing an implementation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based on CPIM. Compared with the existing service-customization techniques, SECUM is a service customization model internal to network system and may provide more powerful capabilities of service customization.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things has contributed to make smarter houses and buildings in the last decades. Different existing works already integrate IoT technologies in homes, but end-user needs continuously change and researchers must face this challenge in identifying platforms to fast prototype solutions satisfying these new needs. This paper presents a solution that demonstrates how well-known fast-prototyping technologies like Node-RED, IBM Watson, Telegram, Raspberry Pi 4, and secured MQTT can contribute to develop complex systems facing the challenge. The selected tools are used within a smart home context to support features inspired by people needs and allow users to: a) consult real time conditions (i.e., temperature, humidity, gas), b) remotely manage lights, c) save energy through a light management system based on user movements, d) remotely monitor the house through dedicated webcams, e) generate warning notifications in case of danger. Users can interact with the systems through a web Node-RED dashboard and a Telegram bot. Differently from existing works, the feasibility of the implemented system and the efficacy of the exploited platforms are demonstrated through a running scenario extracted from a consolidated study on user needs in smart homes. The performed experiment can facilitate the fast prototyping of new solutions.},

   abstract = {Smart home technology has gained widespread adoption. However, several instances of massive corporate surveillance and episodes of sensor data breaches have raised many privacy concerns amongst potential consumers. This paper presents PatrIoT, a private-by-design IoT platform for smart home environments. PatrIoT revisits the typical architecture of existing IoT platforms, and provides an alternative design where the home owner retains full ownership and control of smart device generated data. It leverages Intel SGX to prevent unauthorized access to the data by untrusted IoT cloud providers, and offers homeowners an intuitive security abstraction named flowwall which allows them to specify easy-to-use policies for controlling sensitive sensor data flows within their smart homes. We have built and evaluated a PatrIoT prototype. Most of the participants in a field study considered PatrIoT to be easy to use, and the supported policies to be useful in protecting their privacy.},

   abstract = {The recent trend of ubiquitous access to embedded physical devices over the Internet as well as increasing penetration of wireless protocols such as ZigBee has raised attention to smart homes. These systems consist of sensors, devices and smart appliances that can be monitored and controlled remotely by human users and cloud services. However, the lack of a de facto communication standard for smart homes creates a barrier against the interoperability of devices from different vendors. We address this challenge by proposing a holistic, extensible software architecture that seamlessly integrates heterogeneous protocol-and vendor-specific devices and services, while making these services securely available over the Internet. Our architecture is developed on top of the OSGi framework and incorporates a semantic model of a smart home system. As a result, we achieve semantic interoperability-the ability to integrate new applications and drivers into the deployed system during runtime. Furthermore, we integrate a new access control model for specific smart home scenarios. As a proof of our concept, we demonstrate the seamless semantic discovery of home devices at runtime by integrating several protocols including X10, Insteon, ZigBee and UPnP into a real test. Using smart phones and cloud services together with our home gateway implementation, we further demonstrate the ease of integration of new applications and drivers. © 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Viani2013,
   abstract = {Application of wireless technologies in the smart home is dealt with by pointing out advantages and limitations of available approaches for the solution of heterogeneous and coexisting problems related to the distributed monitoring of the home and the inhabitants. Some hot challenges facing the exploitation of noninvasive wireless devices for user behavior monitoring are then addressed and the application fields of smart power management and elderly people monitoring are chosen as representative cases where the estimation of user activities improves the potential of location-aware services in the smart home. The problem of user localization is considered with great care to minimize the invasiveness of the monitoring system. Wireless architectures are reviewed and discussed as flexible and transparent tools toward the paradigm of a totally automatic/autonomic environment. With respect to available state-of-the-art solutions, our proposed architecture is based also on existing wireless devices and exploits, in an opportunistic way, the characteristics of wireless signals to estimate the presence, the movements, and the behaviors of inhabitants, reducing the system complexity and costs. Selected and representative examples from real implementations are presented to give some insight on state-of-the-art solutions also envisaging possible future trends. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},
